The annual GHC conference is one of the largest gatherings for women in computing. This conference is great for learning from lectures, networking for internships and jobs, and bonding with fellow programmers!  
Registration opens mid-July. Tickets are bought [here](https://ghc.anitaborg.org/ghc-17/).
