# About SIMCOM
SIMCOM specializes in aircraft simulations for training purposes. On the trip, students were shown around the facility and were able to test the simulators! We plan on returning to SIMCOM next year, so keep an eye out if you would like to come on the next trip!  

More information about SIMCOM can be found [here on their website](www.simulator.com)
