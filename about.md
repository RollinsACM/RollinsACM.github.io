# About Rollins ACM Student Chapter
The Rollins Student Chapter of the Association of Computing Machinery was created to provide more educational experiences outside the classroom. Meeting attendees gain further exposure to coding practice and challenging problems, while simulataneously preparing for their future in the field.
<!--excerpt-->

The ACM gives students the opportunity to give lessons on new topics they have learned, whether that be from an internship, current job, or self-taught. Requested topics are always welcome as well in order to gain exposure to previously unintroduced topics. Past student lessons have included MongoDB, agile tools, Jekyll, GitHub, drones, building robots, Raspberry Pi, and others.

In addition to student lessons, professors and guests have attended meetings to give talks about various subjects, including but not limited to Security, A.I. and Psychology, and Gamification.

Due to our location, there are many tech conferences and other education opportunities in the area. Part of the responsibility of the ACM is to keep its members informed on such events, as well as outside conferences, volunteer opportunities, and local meetups.

Attendees of ACM meetings can expect to be more familiar with the technical interview practice and what to look out for. With each meeting new problems are introduced that will give students more practice, as well as resources that students can use to practice on their own. In addition, students have had access to mock interviews that recreate the experience of the technical interview that have left them more confident in their abilities.

This alone does not sum up the ACM, as the possibilities of what we cover in our meetings are infinite. Topics in this field change constantly, so there is always something new to be learned, and so much out there to be discovered.

Ready to join us? Whether you're entirely new to this, major, non-major, or very experienced, we'd love for you to join us. We meet Tuesday evenings at 8:00 P.M. in Bush 301. Feel free to come at any time and learn something new!
