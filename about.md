I am a programmer, web developer, and Linux enthusiast. I currently dabble in web and mobile app development, but have an interest in IoT and automation. 

I'm also a student at Rollins College pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Environmental Studies. I am passionate about advancing urban agriculture through technology.  

I also dabble in astrophotography, and can quite often be found in a field meddling around with my camera and telescope.
